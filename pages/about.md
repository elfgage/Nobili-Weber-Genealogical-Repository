## About the Collection

This site is a compilation of genealogical objects related to one or more branches of the Nobili-Weber Family. Lucia Nobili Weber was a key source in generating the current content of the site. The repository is designed to have sources continue to add objects and metadata pertaining to those objects with the purpose of illuminating the intersections of the families and their descendants.
